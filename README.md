The build is early checked in at May 27, 2020, 11:21:32 AM.

## Implementation
- In `up.js` I coded `customize` and `postconfiguration` function according to homework requirements. 
- To implement `v ssh` command, I added a new file `ssh.js` to the `commands` folder. The code of `ssh.js` is inspired by the source code of bakerx, which has a very similar functionality: https://github.com/ottomatica/bakerx/blob/master/lib/commands/ssh.js
